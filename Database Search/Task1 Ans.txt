1. Comparison: Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases

Flat File Systems store data in simple files (like Excel, CSV, text files), while Relational Databases store data in structured tables with relationships.

Below is a clear comparison covering all required points.

| Feature                         | Flat File Systems                                                                                                     | Relational Databases (RDBMS)                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**                   | Data stored in a single file or multiple independent files (e.g., CSV, TXT). No enforced structure beyond formatting. | Data stored in tables (rows & columns) with defined schema (data types, constraints, keys). |
| **Data Redundancy**             | Very high — the same data is repeated across files because there is no central reference.                             | Low — normalization reduces duplication using keys and relationships.                       |
| **Relationships**               | No built-in relationships. Files are isolated, and relationships must be handled manually.                            | Supports relationships using Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and constraints.                   |
| **Example Usage**               | Small datasets, configuration files, spreadsheets, simple logs.                                                       | Business systems, banking, ecommerce, student systems, inventory, ERP, CRM.                 |
| **Drawbacks**                   | • No relationships                                                                                                    |                                                                                             |

Short Explanation :
Structure

Flat File Systems store data in simple formats like .csv, .txt, or spreadsheets. They lack strict data types and rules.

Relational Databases store data in organized tables with a fixed structure defined by a schema.

Data Redundancy

In flat files, the same information may appear many times — leading to inconsistency.

RDBMS minimizes redundancy using normalization and relationships.

Relationships

Flat files do not support relationships automatically.

RDBMS supports relationships using primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

Example Usage

Flat files → small applications, simple storage, Excel reports.

RDBMS → banking, hospitals, schools, CRM, ecommerce, HR systems.

Drawbacks

Flat files: poor performance, no security, no relationships, lots of redundancy.

RDBMS: requires setup, database knowledge, and more hardware resources.
